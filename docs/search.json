Much of the work is done by a small number of volunteers and there is a need to grow the contributor community.\nThis sprint will bring together novice and experienced contributors, to work alongside members of the R Core Team. Participants will work collaboratively on contributions to base R. The tasks will be prepared in the run-up to the event, but may include:\n\nReviewing, analysing and fixing bugs reported on R’s Bugzilla.\nContributing to message translations via Weblate.\nWork on new developments such as this short project proposed by core developer Paul Murrell: Adding Alpha Masks to the Quartz Graphics Device."

If you are a member of the R-Ladies, MiR, RainbowR, AfricaR, ArabR, AsiaR, or LatinR communities, or otherwise identify as part of an underrepresented group among R contributors, then we especially encourage you to self-nominate!

    "title": "Adding Alpha Masks to the Quartz Graphics Device",
    "section": "",
    "text": "R version 4.1 added the concept of alpha masks to R graphics, with an interface in the ‘grid’ graphics system.\n\nlibrary(grid)\n\nAny shape(s) can be used to create an alpha mask, but the only thing that matters is the opacity of the final result. The mask below is based on a circle, the important part being that it has a semitransparent fill (a line segment is drawn to show that the circle is semitransparent; the line is visible through the circle). Outside the circle, where we have drawn nothing, the mask is fully transparent.\n\nac <- circleGrob(r=.3, gp=gpar(col=NA, fill=rgb(0,0,0,.5)))\namask <- as.mask(ac)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can apply a mask to affect what happens when we draw other shapes. For example, we will work with the following rectangles, one tall and thin and red and one short and wide and green.\n\nr1 <- rectGrob(width=.2, gp=gpar(fill=2))\nr2 <- rectGrob(height=.2, gp=gpar(fill=3))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following code draws the red rectangle, then pushes a viewport that enforces the mask (based on the circle), and then draws the green rectangle. The red rectangle is drawn normally, but the mask means that only part of the green rectangle is drawn (where the rectangle and the circlular mask overlap) and that part is only drawn semitransparent (because the mask is semitransparent).\n\ngrid.rect()\ngrid.draw(r1)\npushViewport(viewport(mask=amask))\ngrid.draw(r2)\npopViewport()\n\n\n\n\nR version 4.2 added the concept of luminance masks. As with alpha masks, we can create a luminance masks with any shape, but what matters is not the opacity of the final result, but the luminance of the final result; whether the mask is black (which corresponds to full transparency), or white (full opacity), or grey (semitransparency).\nWe will again work with a mask based on a circle, but this time the circle just has an opaque grey fill (we cannot see the line segment through the circle).\n\nlc <- circleGrob(r=.3, gp=gpar(col=NA, fill=\"grey50\"))\nlmask <- as.mask(lc, type=\"luminance\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following code draws the red rectangle, then pushes a viewport with the luminance mask, then draws the green rectangle. The result is the same as for the alpha mask, but this time the result is due to the grey values in the luminance mask, where before the result was due to the opacity value in the alpha mask.\nWe have to use the pdf() device to demonstrate a luminance mask because the Cairo graphics device that was used for previous images only supports alpha masks.\n\npdf(\"lumi-mask.pdf\", width=2, height=2)\ngrid.rect()\ngrid.draw(r1)\npushViewport(viewport(mask=lmask))\ngrid.draw(r2)\npopViewport()\ndev.off()\n\n\n\nWarning in system(\"convert -density 96 lumi-mask.pdf lumi-mask.png\"): error in\nrunning command"

    "text": "Proposed solution\nThe implementation of luminance masks for the quartz() device involves creating a greyscale bitmap image and drawing the mask shapes onto that. This happens in the C function QuartzCreateMask() (in R/src/library/grDevices/src/devQuartz.c). The Quartz function CGContextClipToMask() uses that greyscale image to clip output.\nThe proposal is that an alpha mask could be implemented by creating an RGBA bitmap image (instead of a greyscale image) for drawing the mask shapes onto and then converting that image to a greyscale one based on the alpha channel of the RGBA image. Once we have a greyscale image from the alpha mask, we can proceed as before.\nThe dev->capabilities() of the quartz() device would also need updating."
