    "title": "Adding Alpha Masks to the Quartz Graphics Device",
    "section": "",
    "text": "R version 4.1 added the concept of alpha masks to R graphics, with an interface in the ‘grid’ graphics system.\n\nlibrary(grid)\n\nAny shape(s) can be used to create an alpha mask, but the only thing that matters is the opacity of the final result. The mask below is based on a circle, the important part being that it has a semitransparent fill (a line segment is drawn to show that the circle is semitransparent; the line is visible through the circle). Outside the circle, where we have drawn nothing, the mask is fully transparent.\n\nac <- circleGrob(r=.3, gp=gpar(col=NA, fill=rgb(0,0,0,.5)))\namask <- as.mask(ac)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can apply a mask to affect what happens when we draw other shapes. For example, we will work with the following rectangles, one tall and thin and red and one short and wide and green.\n\nr1 <- rectGrob(width=.2, gp=gpar(fill=2))\nr2 <- rectGrob(height=.2, gp=gpar(fill=3))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following code draws the red rectangle, then pushes a viewport that enforces the mask (based on the circle), and then draws the green rectangle. The red rectangle is drawn normally, but the mask means that only part of the green rectangle is drawn (where the rectangle and the circlular mask overlap) and that part is only drawn semitransparent (because the mask is semitransparent).\n\ngrid.rect()\ngrid.draw(r1)\npushViewport(viewport(mask=amask))\ngrid.draw(r2)\npopViewport()\n\n\n\n\nR version 4.2 added the concept of luminance masks. As with alpha masks, we can create a luminance masks with any shape, but what matters is not the opacity of the final result, but the luminance of the final result; whether the mask is black (which corresponds to full transparency), or white (full opacity), or grey (semitransparency).\nWe will again work with a mask based on a circle, but this time the circle just has an opaque grey fill (we cannot see the line segment through the circle).\n\nlc <- circleGrob(r=.3, gp=gpar(col=NA, fill=\"grey50\"))\nlmask <- as.mask(lc, type=\"luminance\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following code draws the red rectangle, then pushes a viewport with the luminance mask, then draws the green rectangle. The result is the same as for the alpha mask, but this time the result is due to the grey values in the luminance mask, where before the result was due to the opacity value in the alpha mask.\nWe have to use the pdf() device to demonstrate a luminance mask because the Cairo graphics device that was used for previous images only supports alpha masks.\n\npdf(\"lumi-mask.pdf\", width=2, height=2)\ngrid.rect()\ngrid.draw(r1)\npushViewport(viewport(mask=lmask))\ngrid.draw(r2)\npopViewport()\ndev.off()\n\n\n\nWarning in system(\"convert -density 96 lumi-mask.pdf lumi-mask.png\"): error in\nrunning command"

    "text": "Problem statement\nFor R version 4.3, support for luminance masks is being added to the Quartz graphics device in R (quartz() on MacOS). Unfortunately, in a reverse of the Cairo graphics device problem, Quartz graphics only supports luminance masks so we have not implemented alpha masks on the quartz() device."

    "title": "Adding Alpha Masks to the Quartz Graphics Device",
    "section": "Proposed solution",
    "text": "Proposed solution\nThe implementation of luminance masks for the quartz() device involves creating a greyscale bitmap image and drawing the mask shapes onto that. This happens in the C function QuartzCreateMask() (in R/src/library/grDevices/src/devQuartz.c). The Quartz function CGContextClipToMask() uses that greyscale image to clip output.\nThe proposal is that an alpha mask could be implemented by creating an RGBA bitmap image (instead of a greyscale image) for drawing the mask shapes onto and then converting that image to a greyscale one based on the alpha channel of the RGBA image. Once we have a greyscale image from the alpha mask, we can proceed as before.\nThe dev->capabilities() of the quartz() device would also need updating."

Many strategies in machine learning are explicitly designed to reduce this test error, possibly at the expense of increased training error. These strategies are collectively known as regularisation and they are instrumental for good performance of any kind of prediction or classification model, especially in the context of small data (many features, few samples).\nIn the hands-on tutorial we will use R to perform an integrated analysis of multi-omics data with penalised regression.\n\nContact\nInstructor A: contact\nInstructor B: contact\nInstructor C: contact"
