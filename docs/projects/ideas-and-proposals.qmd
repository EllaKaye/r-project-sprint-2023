title: "Ideas and Proposals"
---

## Background

Anyone in the R community is welcome to propose a project for R Project Sprint 2023. 
However, priority will be given to projects supported by the R Core Team and 
projects will require interest from at 
least two sprint participants to be taken on as a sprint project.

## Proposals vs Ideas

A **project proposal** should outline a specific package of work related to code 
or documentation maintained by the R Core Team, where good progress 
could be made by 2-6 people in Â½ to 3 days. 

For example:

 - Addressing a set of related bugs reported on [R's Bugzilla](https://bugs.r-project.org/).
 - Implementing a given solution to address "TODO" or "FIXME" comments in the R sources.
 - Making specific improvements to contributor infrastructure, such the [Weblate server](https://translate.rx.studio/).

If you want to discuss early stage-ideas or propose small tasks that could be 
bundled in a larger project, open a thread in the [ideas](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/discussions/categories/ideas) 
category of Discussions in the [r-project-sprint-2023](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023) repository .

## Add a Project Proposal

Collaborators on the [r-project-sprint-2023](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023) repository ([everyone](https://github.com/orgs/r-devel/teams/everyone) who is a member of the R-devel GitHub organization) can add 
a project proposal as follows:

1. Clone the [r-project-sprint-2023](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023) 
repository.
2. Within `/projects`, copy the `template` directory and name the copy in kebab case with a 
suitable short name (e.g. `short-project-name`).
3. In the new directory, edit the `index.qmd` or `index.Rmd` as you prefer, deleting the unused template 
file. Preview locally by rendering the Quarto website or knitting the R markdown file.
4. Commit the `.[qR]md`. The website is updated automatically by GitHub actions.
5. When your project page page is live, add a reaction above the comment box at the bottom - this will open a thread in the [proposals](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/discussions/categories/proposals) 
section of `r-project-sprint-2023` Discussions.
6. [Optional] Add labels to the discussion thread with the categories you added 
to your proposal.

If you have a GitHub account but are not a collaborator on the `r-project-sprint-2023` repository, you can use the 
[standard workflow to make a pull request](https://github.com/forwards/first-contributions). 
You will not be able to add labels to the discussion thread.

If you do not have a GitHub account, copy the [R markdown template file](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/projects/template/index.Rmd), 
edit to create your proposal and submit to [r-project-sprint-2023\@gaggle.email](mailto:r-project-sprint-2023@gaggle.email) 
for it to be added to the website and for a corresponding discussion thread to be created.
Please note it may be several days before the website is updated and any updates 
to your proposal must be processed the same way.
